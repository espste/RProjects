# In particular, it is a data structure in R that represents cases in 
# which there are a number of observations(rows) or measurements (columns).
#
# A data frame is being used for storing data tables, 
# the vectors that are contained in the form of a list in a data frame are
# of equal length.
#
# The following variable df is a data frame containing three variables vec,
# char_vec and bool_vec.

int_vec <- c(1,2,3)
char_vec <- c("a", "b", "c")
bool_vec <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)

data_frame <- data.frame(int_vec, char_vec, bool_vec)

# A data frame is an array. Unlike an array, the data we store in the columns 
# of the data frame can be of various types. It means one column might be a 
# numeric variable, another might be a factor, and a third might be a 
# character variable. All columns have to be of the same length.

# Now, letâ€™s discuss the characteristics of data frame in R.
# - The column names should be non-empty.
# - The row names should be unique.
# - The data frame can hold the data wich can be a numeric, character
#   or of factor type.
# - Each column should contain the same number of data items.
